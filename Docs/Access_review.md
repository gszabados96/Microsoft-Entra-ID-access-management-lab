# Access review doc

# Findings
    1. Found 3 accounts that were disabled, but are still supposed to be enabled due to ongoing contract (filtered to disabled accounts).
    2. Anjana Friseal from Finance/HR teams has the "Global Administrator" and "Global Secure Access Admin" roles.

    
# Remediations
    1. Manually enabled the disabled accounts with the ongoing contracts. (went to the User profile -> clicked on "Edit" under "Account Status"
        Ticked the "Account Enabled" option).
            1.a Also put a screenshot of the audit trail of the user enablement.
    2. Removed the "Global Administrator" and "Global Secure Access Admin" roles from Anjana's account to prevent a potential breach or misuse of
        highly elevated role.
            2.a A screen recording of the process has also been added.
